In this project we are exploring solutions for accelerating MRI image processing, using machine learning techniques. 

In the first part of the project, we are using MODL framework to train a model to remove aliasing artifacts on MRI images due to undersampling. 

In the second part of the project, we will train a GAN model to generate segmented images.
